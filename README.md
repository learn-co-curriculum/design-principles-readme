# Principles of Object Oriented Design

## Objectives

1. Define "design" in the context of coding.
2. Explain why design principles are important for you as a programmer.
3. Learn some of the basic design principles that object orientated programmers employ. 


## What is Code Design and Why Implement It?

A program's *design* refers to the manner in which you, the programmer, organize and arrange the code of which it is constituted. The manner in which you arrange your code may seem incidental to the overarching objective of writing code that *works*, of creating a program that behaves as you want and need it to. Implementing design principles, however, is not incidental to writing working code, it is the manner in which you will ensure that the code you write will continue to work in the future. 

As programmers, we must code for the future. What does that mean? It means that, inevitably, our programs will grow and require change. Let's say you wrote a super cool web application that becomes wildly popular––how will your program change to accommodate more users and more traffic and the needs of those users? On the other hand, let's say you build an amazing application for a client who then changes their mind about an important feature. What do you do? Scrap all of your work and begin again? By writing code that is flexible and accommodates change, you won't have to. 

There is another reason why we value design principles as object oriented programmers––our own happiness. Especially as Rubyists, working in a language specifically designed to be a pleasure to work with, we care about making programs that are a pleasure to code and a pleasure for others to work with.

As programmers, we combine the functions of inventors and artists and the code we write should be designed to function well, be flexible to accommodate future change, and be organized in a sensical, logical, even beautiful way. In the words of Sandi Metz, author of Principles of Object Oriented Design (POODR),

## Basic Design Principles

The study of and refinement of the principles of object oriented design will take place over decades of a programmer's life and career. This reading is meant to function as a very basic introduction to the what and why of object oriented design. Here, we'll briefly discuss some of the basic principles. Keep these principles in mind as you continue to learn more about object oriented Ruby and revisit them in your future work. 

### What are Object Oriented Design Principles?

>Design is not the act of following a fixed set of rules, it’s a journey along a branching path wherein earlier choices close off some options and open access to others. During design you wander through a maze of requirements where every juncture represents a decision point that has consequences for the future. Just as a sculptor has chisels and files, an object-oriented designer has tools—principles and patterns.

### The Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns

The single responsibility principle is the idea that classes in object-oriented programming should have one job, one responsibility, and their services (i.e., methods) should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. This principle goes hand in hand with the separation of concerns––the idea that the various responsibilities, or concerns, of a computer program should be separated out into discrete sections. 

Let's take the example of an online shopping web application. Such an application has a number of jobs to handle: we need to have users that sign in and purchase items, we have the items themselves that we are selling, we likely have a shopping cart as well. We could develop an application that that takes care of all of these jobs in the following manner: 

```ruby
class MyStore

  def sign_in(user)
    @user = user
  end
  
  def current_user
    @user
  end
  
  def item(item_name)
    @item = item
  end
  
  def item_price=(item, price)
    @item_price = price
  end
  
  
  def shopping_cart
    @shopping_cart = []
  end
  
  def add_item_to_cart(item)
    @shopping_cart << item
  end
  
  ...
  
end
``` 

As you can see, our code starts to deteriorate relatively quickly. How can we give an item a price? How can we retrieve that price later? What happens when our program needs to grow to accommodate a feature like coupons? Will we continue to add code to this one file? What happens if our program breaks? How will we determine which of our many methods is responsible for the bug? 

Instead, we want to separate the concerns, or responsibilities, of such an application, wrapping each concern in its own class that produces its own objects. We could write a User class, an `Item` class and a `ShoppingCart` class. The User class should be responsible for assigning a user a name and other details and signing a user in and out. The Item class should have methods that describe an item's attributes, including its price. The `ShoppingCart` class can collect individual item objects and total their price at the time of checkout. By creating classes with their own responsibilities, we create an application that is organized, logical, and accommodates future change. We also create a program that doesn't give us a headache to even look at. 

### Abstraction and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Another basic OO principle is that of DRY. If you find yourself repeating the same lines of code again and again, that is a good candidate for refactoring. As programmers, we are lazy (in a good way!), we are always looking for ways to achieve the desired behavior by writing less code, and we hate to repeat ourselves. Let's take a look at an example by revisiting our online shopping application. 

Lately, our client has been offering a variety of discounts. At the time of checkout, a user can tell our application that they have a 10, 25, or 50 percent discount. So, our program needs to determine if a user has a discount and then apply it, if present. Let's take a look at the `checkout` method of our `ShoppingCart` class.

```ruby
def checkout(discount=number)
  total = 0
  #the shopping_cart method holds an array of all the user's items
  shopping_cart.each do |item|
    total += item.price
  end
  
  if discount == 10
    total = 10/total
  elsif discount == 20
    total = 20/total
  elsif discount == 50
    total = 50/total
  end
  
  total
    
end
``` 

In the above method, we are using an if/elsif statement to determine what kind of discount a user has, if any, and then doing some math to calculate the appropriate total. In order to take a discount into account, we are using six lines of code every time we checkout a user! That's a lot of repetition. Additionally, what if our application needs to apply coupons to a user's total *before* they checkout? Maybe our client has decided to give their user's 20% on their current total if they refer a friend to the site. We would have to use the same if/elsif statement elsewhere in our code. That's a lot of code to constantly re-type. 

**Top-Tip:** If you find yourself copy/pasting the same lines of code more than three times in order to re-use it throughout your program, consider it a "code smell". A code smell is a sign that you should refactor.

Let's refactor this by creating a `coupon` attr_accessor. Then, our checkout method can simply use the coupon method to help it calculate the user's total:

```ruby
class ShoppingCart
  attr_accessor :coupon
  
  def checkout
    total = 0
    #the shopping_cart method holds an array of all the user's items
    shopping_cart.each do |item|
      total += item.price
    end
    
    total = coupon/total if coupon
    
    total
    
  end
end
```

We've achieved the same behavior with less code. This refactor has the added benefit of being *flexible*, meaning it will accommodate future change. If our client decides to added a new type of coupon, a 23% off discount, the coupon method, having *abstracted* away the value of the coupon, will still work. This is the benefit of abstraction, and we prefer abstracting out attributes by wrapping them inside methods over having our code rely on literal values.  

Our new `coupon` method is what is referred to as a **helper method**. It functions to assist our `checkout` method and is called inside the checkout master. 

### Line Limits on Methods and Classes

Another OO principle states that methods should not exceed 5 lines of code and classes should not exceed 100. While these principles are not hard and fast rules, they should guide us whenever possible. We should always be on the lookout for ways to pare down our code. Let's take another look at our `checkout` method. 

```ruby
def checkout
    total = 0
    #the shopping_cart method holds an array of all the user's items
    shopping_cart.each do |item|
      total += item.price
    end
    
    total = coupon/total if coupon
    
    total
    
  end
```

Notice that we are trying to collect the prices of every item in our cart. We are doing so by creating a new variable, `total`, setting it equal to 0, iterating over the array of items and incrementing the `total` by the price of each item. That's a lot of code! This code has what we might term a "code smell"––we are using several lines of code to complete a simple task, our code currently requires us to create a variable and set it equal to the placeholder value of 0 *and*, the task of finding the sum of a set of numbers seems like a simple and common task that shouldn't require this much work. 

Sure enough, a quick google search of "sum an array of value ruby" returns some info on the [`inject` method](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject). Let's implement our refactor: 


```ruby
def checkout
  total = shopping_cart.inject {|sum, item| sum + item.price}
  total = coupon/total if coupon
  ...
end
```

Much better!

## Conclusion

This has been a very brief intro into the what, why and how of design principles in object oriented Ruby. These principles are meant to guide you, not limit you. These principles are also just the very tip of the OO design iceberg. You'll learn more about design over the remainder of this course and you'll learn even more about design over the course of the rest of your programming life. Check out the resource below, Sandi Metz's book on object-oriented design, to go deeper. This book is a great resource. It is highly respected among object-oriented Rubyists and you'll likely encounter the principles she discusses in your professional programming life. Even if you don't read it all now, try the first few chapters and then go deeper into it after you've learned more.
